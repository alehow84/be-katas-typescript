# Week 2 kata feedback

- Great start on the counterIntelligence kata Alex!
- It's a really difficult kata this so don't worry too much about only getting halfway through this (and I know you were working on the morning sprint too)
- Nice start with the testing too, great to see you using the examples from the instructions 👍 🙂
